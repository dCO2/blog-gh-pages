I dare say:

But why?

You see, think about this metaphor for a minute: Your thoughts, your intuition, your knowledge and a few of your beliefs are all bubble-balls of inarticulate, probably uninformed and possibly contradictory ideas (for lack of a better word) floating about your headspace every second.

But these bubble-balls are weird. They don't readily coalesce like usual soap bubbles would and every day as you live, you cram thousands of balls of ideas into your tiny; slightly-minimalist headspace without seriously examining or screening or sieving or filtering them.

You clutter your headspace.

What are these bubble-ball ideas?

What are these bubble-ball ideas we fail to seriously examine?
