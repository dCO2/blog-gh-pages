In 1862, at the age of 49, an old American poet, essayist and journalist drafted on a manuscript the bones of a poem that eventually evolved into what is now called A Noiseless Patient Spider; his name is Walt Whitman. In 1881, after 11 years of revision and evolution, the final version of "A Noiseless Patient Spider" was published in his book collection of poems: Leaves of Grass.
