title: On becoming; a Noiseless Patient Spider

In 1862, at the age of 49, an old American poet, essayist and journalist drafted on a manuscript the bones of a poem that eventually evolved into what is now called A Noiseless Patient Spider; his name is Walt Whitman. In 1881, after 11 years of revision and evolution, the final version of "A Noiseless Patient Spider" was published in his book collection of poems: Leaves of Grass.

However, Isn't it rather strange? To write about a Spider, a noiseless patient spider, and publish whatever garbage is written in a book with an overtly grandiose title: Leaves of Grass. What could be more pretentious if not the same bloody highfalutin poetry!

Leanback and ponder what more, of a spider, is worth writing about if not the science about its anatomy, taxonomy, evolution, ethology, ecology, anthrozoology and all the other -ogys of precise science. What, of a spider, is noiseless and patient?

This poem--and all of poetry--may be strange and pretentious; it may be unecessary and irrelevant in the already polymerous -ogy of precise science. But strange is that which is difficult to comprehend--Ignoring for the sake of completeness actual garbage that is written in a bid to experiment with language. It is not a fault on the part of the poetry but a fault on that of the reader. He simply has not forged the faculties to possibly comprehend. It's because of an incompleteness on his part. He is incomplete.

A gentle and more malleable mind willing to understand, eventually, will find that much is to be learned from the Spider Walt uses to metaphorize and that poetry is {even truer} more embracing than our rejection of it. It is more science than our critical mind wishes to admit. If you, too, dislike it. Reading it however, with a perfect contempt for it, you discover in it, after all, a place for the genuine.
