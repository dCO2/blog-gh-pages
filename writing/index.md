**INSERT PHRASE HERE**

But why?

Why is it that what we perceive of ourselves and who we claim to be is not who we actually are 
in reality?

Well, I claim it is because the human mind, our mind, didn't evolve to be minimalist in nature.
Minimalism means being simple, it means using only that which is needed and weeding out the unnecessary. It means clearing the clutter.

If minimalism means being simple, how then does that explain the apparent dissonance between our actual self (as seen by an observer) and our perceived or imagined self?

You see, think about this metaphor for a minute: Your thoughts, your intuition, your knowledge and a few of your beliefs are all bubble-balls of inarticulate, probably uninformed and possibly contradictory ideas (for lack of a better word) floating about your headspace every second.

But these bubble-balls are weird. They don't readily coalesce like usual soap bubbles would and every day as you live, you cram thousands of balls of ideas into your tiny; slightly-minimalist headspace without seriously examining or screening or sieving or filtering them.

You clutter your headspace.

What are these bubble-ball ideas we fail to seriously examine?
